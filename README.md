## About

Small game created with java using the java core Swing graphic library.
The whole idea was to create some game resembling the look of the old ms-dos games I grew up with. 
It has 7 levels (of course more can be added) 

Some of my goals were:
* Use only a text editor (no smart java ide)
* Use only core java, not only for the graphics but for any other thing needed for the game.

If I recall correctly I coded the game using java 8, but it should build and play with any older/newer jvm.
At the time of making this game public, it has been almost 10 years since I coded it, and I haven't changed a word since. 

The graphics were taken from some free game art site that I don't recall the name of at this point.

## Build
```bash
javac *.java
```
## Run
```bash
java Main
```
